  <h1>Welcome to Rebecca Ferjo's ePortfolio</h1>
  <p>This ePortfolio contains my original and enhanced software development projects completed during my Computer Science capstone.</p>

  <h2>👩‍💻 Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
  <p>Completing my coursework in the Computer Science program and assembling this ePortfolio has been a transformative experience that allowed me to reflect deeply on my growth as a computer scientist. Over the course of the program, I developed a strong foundation in technical concepts such as data structures and algorithms, software engineering principles, and secure database management.</p>

  <p>Just as importantly, I honed my ability to work collaboratively, communicate effectively with stakeholders, and adapt to real-world software development scenarios—skills that are essential in today’s professional environments.</p>

  <p>This program pushed me to grow in both academic and practical dimensions. One standout experience was working on the Grazioso Salvare project, where I had to translate a set of client specifications into a functional software product. This involved analyzing large datasets, designing a user-friendly dashboard, and ensuring the database could efficiently handle CRUD operations.</p>

  <p>Team collaboration was another key area of development. Through group-based coding challenges and peer review sessions, I learned the importance of clean, consistent code and how to provide constructive feedback. I also grew more confident in stakeholder communication, especially when it came to explaining technical decisions or clarifying requirements with clarity and professionalism.</p>

  <p>Throughout my coursework, I applied core programming languages like Python and JavaScript and leveraged tools like PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook, and MongoDB. I also gained experience with secure coding techniques such as password hashing and input validation, which were used in several projects.</p>

  <p>The artifacts in this portfolio serve as evidence of my journey. They highlight my technical range, attention to usability, and ability to improve systems through thoughtful, standards-aligned enhancements. As I prepare to enter the professional workforce—particularly in roles supporting defense, data systems, or cybersecurity—I am confident that this portfolio illustrates not only what I’ve learned, but what I can contribute.</p>
