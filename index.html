    <h2>üìù Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
    <p>
      Throughout my academic journey in the Computer Science program, I have gained critical problem-solving, analytical, and technical skills that align closely with my goal of becoming a technician or analyst within the Department of Defense. Developing this ePortfolio allowed me to reflect on my growth, showcase enhancements to past work, and articulate my strengths with quantifiable evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Balancing school, family, and career preparation has helped shape my professional values‚Äîespecially resilience, consistency, and adaptability. These qualities are evident in the refined software engineering practices and client-server integration I‚Äôve implemented. Each artifact included here demonstrates my ability to plan, execute, and enhance real-world applications with user-focused design and performance optimization in mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      By completing this capstone and curating this ePortfolio, I feel confident in my readiness to contribute meaningfully to the tech field and pursue future opportunities that demand integrity, technical fluency, and a passion for continued learning.
